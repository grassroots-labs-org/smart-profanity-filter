Harjas Sandhu
Mar 03, 2026
One year after its inception, Impact Counter has finally thrown in the towel. Its final one-year estimate of deaths from DOGE's dismantling of USAID is 781,343 total deaths, which can be broken down into 262,915 adult deaths and 518,428 child deaths.

Do you know how many people that is? That's almost 200,000 more people than the entire state of Wyoming. If you're only counting kids, it's over 1,000 public schools (which on average have 500 kids).

Hey, but don't worry: Elon managed to "save" $6.7 billion by cutting USAID programs! That means that each person who died because of this decision saved America about $8,575! Hooray!

Oh, also: according to POLITICO, DOGE really saved less than 5 percent of its claimed savings anyways—topping out at about $1.4 billion total—because the money it "saved" is being returned to federal agencies, which are legally mandated to spend it.

And the federal deficit increased by $1.78 trillion in 2025.

I wonder how Elon reacted to this.

There's much to be said about DOGE and the stupid and childish arrogance of our tech overlords' authoritarian power fantasies. Others have talked about this with more insight and eloquence than I can muster right now.

So instead, I will simply say this.

If you live in the US:

Your vote matters.

Your choices matter.

This monstrous loss of life was not inevitable.`;

  const sampleText2 = `I recently had a great conversation with James Özden on his How I Learned to Love Shrimp podcast. I want to expand here on our exchange about the likely effects of plant-based defaults. I (predictably) expressed skepticism that small changes, in general, lead to large effects.

James: I think Lewis [Bollard] in [the] podcast we had with him said, you know, his default for most interventions is they don't work. And when they work, this is a pleasant surprise. But I think for most people, this is not the case. But it seems like you're more in the case of, uh, things don't really work until proven otherwise, or you expect things to be small changes just because it's hard to change the world.

My take: I don't think this is sad. I'm grateful that behavior is stubborn, because if it weren't, any super-effective, low-cost, pro-social intervention could be turned on its head to produce effects we don't like.

This is important to my worldview so I figured I should articulate it more definitively.`;

  const sampleText3 = `Long ago, Berke Breathed actually gave me permission to use this for Anger, Humor, and Advocacy.
I Love Everybody, Especially vegans
One of One Step for Animals' very first supporters recently left the organization because I "disparage vegans and veganism."

Now, I'm not here to argue – this is a completely understandable take. But I do want to clarify:

The people I love don't eat animal products, even if they don't publicly identify as vegan. Nearly all of my close friends would say they are vegan. There are probably dozens if not hundreds of vegans (although no longer thousands) who consider me a friend.

Morality Is Simple
As I have tried to make clear, my only goal is to reduce intense suffering. When it comes to morality, the only thing that matters is our ability to reduce intense suffering.

The real-world consequences of our thoughts and actions are what matter. Not our intentions. Not our logic, our consistency, our lack of hypocrisy.

But for many, a decision originally made to help animals mutates into "Being Vegan" with a capital "V."

This is a "lifestyle," a philosophy, a dogma, a religion. Being Vegan matters in and of itself, rather than a set of real-world choices to oppose factory farming and reduce intense suffering.

Being Vegan becomes a personal identity, rather than one tool among many that we can use to actually reduce intense suffering.

Being "Vegan" doesn't make you great.

Actually helping makes you great.`;

  const sampleText4 = `In early February, I visited UCLA to cover what I thought would be a routine event on the future of AI and science. But I came back with something unexpected: a window into what happens when Trump administration cuts federal funds and pulls the rug out from under American science — told through the eyes of Terence Tao, widely regarded the greatest living mathematician.

In a blog post last year, he wrote that American scientific dominance is founded on two pillars: the historic influx of talent fleeing authoritarian regimes such as Nazi Germany or the former Soviet Union, and the sustained bipartisan investment from the federal government to fund science as a public good. The Trump administration, he argued, is systematically dismantling public funding, without appreciating what was required for science to flourish.

The federal investment in mathematics across the U.S. is $900 million a year, about $3 per person per year.

"You can buy a coffee for more than that," he said.`;

  const sampleText5 = `In an interview late last year on the Dwarkesh Podcast, Adam Marblestone discussed what insights we might extract from complete brain wiring diagrams. His central claim is that the most valuable information in a connectome concerns innate reward functions and motivational systems.

Transcriptomic identity is thus now commonly used for cell-type classification. Each neuron expresses a particular subset of the genome's ~20,000 protein-coding genes. That looming-selective retinal cell I mentioned earlier can be differentiated from other retinal ganglion cells, for example, by how much it expresses the gene Kcnip2 (Wang et al. 2021).`;
